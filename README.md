<h2>Description</h2>
Brief set up of a Windows Server 2019 VM and Windows 10 VM in Microsoft Azure. 


<h2>Environments Used </h2>
- <b>Microsoft Azure Cloud</b>
- <b>Windows Server 2019</b>
- <b>Windows 10</b>



<h2>Project walk-through:</h2>

After Setting Up Windows 10 Pro VM Machine and registering Nessus Essentials we can begin our scans!

We will start with a non credentialed basic network scan.

-->Click New Scan then -->Click Basic Network Scan

We enter a name for the scan and the IP address of our Windows 10 machine --> Click Save.

In the "My Scans" page, -->Click Launch button to start the created scan.

Clicking on the row with the labeled scan opens the page with the scan results.

Vulnerabilities are shown in categories of risk levels.

Clicking on the row will open the page listing the vulnerabilities by their risk levels.

Clicking each vulnerability provides more information such as the description of the vulnerability, the solution for
remediation and an Output message with some information.

Note that the vulnerabilities listed under "Info" are not given risk value but provide some information about the network.

Credentialed Scans

In order to run credentialed scans on the VM we will configure the Windows 10 VM. This done since our machine
is not connected to a domain.

Entering Services.msc in the search bar we will enable remote registry allowing the scan to find any risky configurations.

Next, we navigate to User Account Control Settings and change the setting to Never notify for experimental purposes.

We will further disable account controls by navigating to the registry(regedit) and editing a registry key.

Navigate to HKLM-->Software-->Microsoft-->Windows-->CurrentVersion-->Policies-->System

Within System we add D-Word labed "LocalAccountTokenFilterPolicy" and set the value to 1.

In Nessus, we checkmark our previous scan. The More Tab appears. --> Select Configure in the drop down.

After changing the scan's name in the settings tab, we click the Credentials tab then Windows to fill in our credentials.
These are our log in credentials into the Windows VM. --> Save

Once the credentialed scan is launched we can see that the vulnerability levels have increased.

Running a credentialed scan detected far greater vulnerabilties than the non credentialed scan. 

Let's take a look at the critical vulnerability and what we would need to do to remediate it.

We Click on Mixed then Critical to find the descripion and solution.

The vulnerability is a remote code execution vulnerability within the Microsoft 365 Office app version.

We can resolve the issue by updating the version of the app or uninstalling it.

Let's remove the app and launch the scan again and see if the critical vulnerability shows up in the results.

As we can see from the results above, the critical vulnerability has been resolved.

Let's see what happens when we install Windows 10 Updates.

Navigating to the History Tab, we can compare our scans. We can see that we have one less vulnerability in our post
windows update scan.
